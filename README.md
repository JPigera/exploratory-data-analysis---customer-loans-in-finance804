# Exploratory Data Analysis: Customer Loans in Finance

## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what I learned

An AiCore industry grade project for a large financial institution relating to managing loans.

The aim of the project is to ensure informed decisions are made about loan approvals and risk is efficiently managed, my task is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data.

In this project I perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

This information will enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

By conducting exploratory data analysis on the loan data, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans.

Ultimately, my goal is to improve the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio,
